At Campus Latin America we are working to grow more every day, for this and more reasons with our development team we decided to put into practice what we learned with this incredible Landing Page.

Here's what it is:
* This is an amazing Landing Page that simulate a library store online where you can find content
* You can see customer testimonials and a wide variety of products
* And of course you can contact us with the contact section :smile:

Of course, This is a template that had a layout in Figma and was made only with Bootstrap 5, the project is not functional and is for recreational purposes and is not intended to be sold or offered.

### Built With

This is a template that had a layout in Figma and was made only with Bootstrap 5, the project is not functional and is for recreational purposes and is not intended to be sold or offered.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Sometimes the GitHub Pages have troubles to load the content, so we recomend to download the project and open it inside your own browser with localhost.

### Prerequisites

Actually is not necessary but this is an example.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
* bootstrap
```sh
npm install bootstrap
 ```

### Installation

As was mentioned before sometimes the GitHub Pages can't upload the libraries that we use for bootstrap so you may prefer to use this option

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/TheLuxlibrary/Lux-Library.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
